====================
Scope of the Project
====================
The project creates a suite of tools that automate the task of uploading
documents to a Mayan EDMS instance. These tools use artificial intelligence,
to extract metadata about the document. For example, the business that provided
the document, if the document is a bill, and if so, the amount billed. Documents
are then uploaded to Mayan with the extracted metadata.
