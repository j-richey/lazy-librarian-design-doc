    artificial intelligence
        The ability of machines, such as a computer, to demonstrate intelligence.
        For the purpose of this document, this means the ability to solve
        specific types of problems without needing an explicit list of rules
        provided by an engineer.

    document
        A statement, bill, memorandum, or other written communication. Documents
        can be received in the mail or downloaded from the internet. In
        electronic form these are often stored as PDF files.

    machine learning
        A type of :term:`artificial intelligence` algorithm that is trained
        rather than explicitly programmed.

    Mayan EDMS
        A free and open source electronic :term:`document` management system. It
        serves as a repository for documents. :term:`Metadata <metadata>` is
        attached to documents allowing documents to be organized and quickly
        located.

    metadata
        Information about other data. For example, a :term:`document's <document>`,
        business, date, and category are all pieces of metadata.

    neural network
        A type of :term:`machine learning` algorithm that takes inspiration from
        biological neural networks. These algorithms find statistically
        significant correlations in provided training data allowing them to make
        predictions about future input data.

    PDF file
        A popular file format for storing and sharing :term:`document` files.
        PDF stands for Portable Document Format.
