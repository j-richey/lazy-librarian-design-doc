Objectives of the Project
#########################
The lazy librarian's projective objectives are listed below.


==================================================
Simply Workflow for Adding Documents to Mayan EDMS
==================================================
Users must perform several manual steps before a document can be uploaded to
Mayan EDMS. An objective of this project is to automate these manual steps.
This simplifies the user's workflow thus saving them time.

================================
Learn About Deep Neural Networks
================================
Deep neural networks are being used more often for a verity of computational tasks.
This includes image classification, movie recommendations, and self-driving cars. [#NN]_
Understanding the concepts behind artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
deep neural networks is growing in importance. This project uses modern machine
learning techniques thus providing a deeper understanding of these techniques.

===================================
Provide Small but Frequent Releases
===================================
An iterative development approach is taken to provide small but frequent product
releases. Even partial automation of the document upload steps helps simplify
the user's workflow and provides insight to neural networks. Therefore, small
but frequent releases are provided where each release adds additional workflow
automation or improved accuracy of existing automated tasks.
